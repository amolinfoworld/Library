# Library
library management system is one that organizes and saves booksâ€™ information electronically to meet the needs of students.

Both students and library managers benefit from the system, which allows them to keep track of all of the books available in the library at all times. It allows both the administrator and the student to look for the book they want.

Colleges must now keep a constant eye on the books they issue and return, as well as the transaction records. If this operation is completed manually, it will be time-consuming and prone to errors.
